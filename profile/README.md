## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've got distributed, disconnected systems to help me do things like publish a podcast (`bootiful-podcast`), compose weekly roundups (`this-week-in`), and - soon - to enrich videos on youtube (`youtube-atoms`). 

Could this be a chance to consolidate? Force as much as possible into one modular monolithic codebase using Spring Moduliths and GraalVM? 

## considerations 




 


this api backend would expose feeds, eg, ATOM for content published (blogs, youtube videos, podcasts), as well as a read-only graphql api. so i could then build bootifulpodcast.fm, joshlong.com, springtipslive.io, etc., to talk to these feeds.
